Create a Python program to implement a singly linked list with the following operations:

#### Requirements:
1. *Node Class:*
   - Attributes: data (to store the value) and next (to point to the next node).

2. *LinkedList Class:*
   - Attributes: head (to point to the first node in the list).
   - Methods:
     - append(data): Adds a new node with the given data to the end of the list.
     - prepend(data): Adds a new node with the given data to the beginning of the list.
     - display(): Prints all the elements in the linked list.
     - delete(data): Deletes the first occurrence of a node with the given data.

3. *Tasks:*
   - Create a linked list and append the following elements: 10, 20, 30.
   - Prepend the element 5 to the list.
   - Display the linked list.
   - Delete the element 20 from the list.
   - Display the updated linked list
